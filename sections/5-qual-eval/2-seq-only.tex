\section{Limitation of Checkpointing to Sequences} \label{sec:5-qual-eval-seq-only}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=0.2em]
    \item only sequences. actually only trees.
    \item But NNs graphs
    \item Must perform treedecomp to trees, but unknown treewidth even though probably small
    \item divide-and-conquer checkpointing generalises REVOLVE to trees, but is arbitrary C-M
    \item Two new papers: `graph theoretic framework' and `re-forward' generalise checkpointing to graphs. How well? Require user help? Arbitrary costs? Multiple Recomps? C-M?
\end{itemize}
