In this chapter, I will give a qualitative evaluation of my work and suggest directions for further work.
I will describe the limitations of my technique and, where possible, suggest ideas for remedying them.
I will assess the role of checkpointing in relation to other optimisation techniques and discuss how they can be combined based on their various merits and drawbacks.

% \begin{enumerate}[topsep=0.2em]
%     \item Limitation to sequences
%     \item Intractability on M and unneeded perfect optimality in real world: solve with RL techniques
%     \item Implementation in PyTorch
%     \item Relation to other techniques, esp. swapping, defrag, conv alg 
%     \item Really future work?
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Really need to reconcile knowledge with AD, DBs, compilers, general DAGs
%     \end{itemize}
